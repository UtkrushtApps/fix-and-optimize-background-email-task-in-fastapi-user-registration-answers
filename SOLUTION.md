# Solution Steps

1. Create a FastAPI application instance in main.py.

2. Define a Pydantic model (UserCreate) for user registration, including username and email fields.

3. Set up an in-memory data structure (e.g., a set) to act as a fake user database for uniqueness checking.

4. Implement a 'send_welcome_email' function that simulates sending an email (e.g., with a log statement and a brief sleep to simulate delay), but does not block the main thread.

5. In the user registration endpoint (/register), check if the email is already registered; if so, return an HTTP 400 error.

6. If the email is not registered, add it to the fake user database to simulate account creation.

7. Use the FastAPI BackgroundTasks dependency to schedule the 'send_welcome_email' function as a background task after user registration, passing the user's email and username.

8. Return an HTTP 201 response promptly to the client, indicating the registration was successful and that a welcome email will be sent.

9. Add logging to the email sending function to simulate and observe background activity without blocking the API response.

10. Test the API to confirm that registration responds quickly and emails are 'sent' in the background.
